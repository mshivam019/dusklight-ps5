# PS5 Vulkan - link recipe for titles that link RADV.

# Sourced by tools/build-radv-title.sh (and, later, by every title that links
# the RADV archive), so each links it the same way:
# - the archive my Mesa fork builds with -Dradv-winsys=ps5 (RADV, its compiler
#   and Mesa's runtime in one), linked whole;
# - the payload SDK's libc++, libc++abi and libunwind for ACO's C++, and
#   Clang's builtins for __emutls_get_address, as tools/psbc-link.sh has them;
# - the SDK's platform layer, whose ps5_ functions stand in for the libc
#   functions no system module exports, bound to libc's names here: a title
#   that defined libc's names itself would export them, which the title
#   converter refuses (platform/include/ps5platform/libc.h in the SDK fork).

# radv_link_recipe ROOT SDK_ROOT ARCHIVE sets radv_linker_script,
