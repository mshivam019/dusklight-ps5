 * which system module exports what, and every behaviour below was measured
 * by one of our titles.
 *
 *   gmtime_r, localtime_r, utimensat, futimens, dirfd, clock_nanosleep,
 *   arc4random, arc4random_buf, arc4random_uniform, if_nameindex, strcasestr,

 *   fchown
 *                          no system module exports them
 *   openat, unlinkat, fchmodat, fstatat, mkdirat, renameat
 *                          only libkernel_sys exports them, which titles do
 *                          not import: the imports resolve to nothing
 *   statvfs, fstatvfs      exported by libc but built on statfs (only in
 *                          libkernel_sys): they fault
 *   opendir and its family exported, but refused to a title; enumeration
 *                          goes through getdents
 *   getaddrinfo, freeaddrinfo, getnameinfo, gethostbyname, gai_strerror
 *                          routed by the SDK to a module titles do not load
 *   qsort_r, mkstemps, openlog, uname (__xuname), regcomp, regexec,
 *   regfree, regerror, __assert, __memset_chk
 *                          no system module exports them (the SDK's own
 *                          FreeBSD headers call the last two)
 *   newlocale, freelocale, strtod_l, strtof_l, dladdr
 *                          no system module exports them; the locale is "C"
 *   popen, pclose          no system module exports them, nor fork: they fail
 *                          as POSIX lets them
 *   open_memstream         no system module exports it, nor funopen,
 *                          fopencookie or fmemopen: libc's FILE on a pipe,
 *                          published through fclose and fflush wraps
 *   memfd_create           no system module exports it: libkernel's anonymous
 *                          shared memory object, as FreeBSD 13 builds it
 *   accept4, getpagesizes, in6addr_any
 *                          no system module exports them
 *   realpath               refused to a title (EPERM), even for /app0: resolved
 *                          from the names and stat(), which libc++'s
 *                          std::filesystem canonical paths are built on
 *   syscall                a title may make no system call: write for SYS_write
 *                          (Abseil's raw logging), ENOSYS for the rest
 *   sysconf                exported, but _SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN and _CONF answer
 *                          16 where a title's threads run on 13
 *   pthread_getaffinity_np, pthread_setaffinity_np
 *                          exported, but refuse sets larger than 16 bytes
 *                          (ERANGE), FreeBSD's 32-byte cpuset_t among them:
 *                          the exported 64-bit mask form answers instead
 *
 * They carry a ps5_ prefix: a title that defined libc's own names would
 * export them, which the title converter refuses. Each consumer binds the
 * standard names to these its own way (the title's link wraps, its core
 * loader's import table). The kernel a title talks to applies no file mode
 * mask: ps5_umask says so (0) and keeps nothing, since an emulated mask that
 * nothing applies would only mislead; code that needs a file's mode sets it
 * after creating the file.
 *
 *   statfs, fstatfs, umask, fork, setsid, wait4
 *                          only libkernel_sys exports them: the imports
 *                          resolve to nothing
